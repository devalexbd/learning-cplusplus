# Small C++ Learning Projects

These are a small programs as I learn to familiarise myself with how C++ operates.

## If & Switch Statements

 - Solar System Calculator & Calculator 2

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the different ways in which If and Switch statements work.
The user enters a weight and selects a numbered planet, the program then returns what that weight would be on that planet.

## Logical Operators

 - Leap Year Calculator

Showing the use of AND and OR gates.
This allows the user to enter a year (that must be a four digit number) and it works out whether it's a leap year by seeing if it meets any of the If statement's criteria.
This being: `(year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0)`.

## While Loop

 - Square Numbers

Using a while loop, as i increments the `square` variable must equal i multiplied by itself.

## For Loop

 - 99 Bottles

Using a For loop, recreate the stanza of the 99 Bottles number song while changing the value of i each time. Do this 99 times.
