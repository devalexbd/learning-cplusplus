# Small C++ Learning Projects

These are a small programs as I learn to familiarise myself with how C++ operates.


## If & Switch Statements

 - Solar System Calculator & Calculator 2

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the different ways in which If and Switch statements work.
The user enters a weight and selects a numbered planet, the program then returns what that weight would be on that planet.


## Logical Operators

 - Leap Year Calculator

Showing the use of AND and OR gates.
This allows the user to enter a year (that must be a four digit number) and it works out whether it's a leap year by seeing if it meets any of the If statement's criteria.
This being: `(year % 4 == 0 && year % 100 != 0 || year % 400 == 0)`.


## While Loop

 - Square Numbers

Using a while loop, as i increments the square variable must equal i multiplied by itself.


## For Loop

 - 99 Bottles

Using a For loop, recreate the stanza of the 99 Bottles number song while changing the value of i each time. Do this 99 times.


## Vectors

 - Total Orders
 - Sum Product

For both of these programs, I create a vector containing a list of values of a particular type.
In Total Orders, I use the current index (i) to add each value in the list to the variable 'total'.
In Sum Product, I use an If statement inside of the For loop to check if the current index is an even number. If it is, I add their sum to evenSum; if not, I add their product to oddProduct.
